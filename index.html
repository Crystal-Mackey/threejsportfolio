        <h2>üìú Get To Know Me</h2>
        <p>
          While not traditionally from the Tech world, through learning and experimentation I have come to learn that I love creating beautiful graphics that enchance a user's experience. I believe in giving more positive vibes and less toxic in the world. I strive to do that through visuals.
        </p>

        <p>
       Hard work is no stranger in my life. Single mother of a handsome little man who happens to also be autistic. Time management and patience are a key part of everyday life in my household. I have to be ready to adapt and go with the flow at any point in time throughout the day. I wouldn't change him for the world. My motivation to succeed is to take care of him and my mother and ensure those I love are forever taken care of. Nothing is stronger than a mother's love.
        </p>

        <p>
          Growing up I did whatever I could that paid the best but as I am getting older I know the importance of stability and growth. That is why I have made the transition to tech. I know that with technology there is no reason I can't stay at home with my little man and help to improve the world. I believe that you can never know enough (especially with how quickly things can become deprecated) and therefore and constantly wanting to learning and grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Going forward in the tech world I have a few strong goals. I have learned HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, Redux, Python and Django but I intend to expand my knowledge base. Those languages allowed me to learn how to learn tech. I intend to expand my learning into more 3D modeling and eventually into the virtual reality space. I have several projects in mind that I will be estactic to make once I have learned enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a few causes that are close to my heart and if I were to work with those that made an effort to support those causes, I would find my work extra fulfilling. I specifically want to support Child/Infant Loss, Preemies, Animcal Conservation, and Autism related causes.
